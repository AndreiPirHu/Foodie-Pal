# Foodie Pal
Foodie Pal is a food truck tracker made with SwiftUI.


## Owners

Foodie Pal is a tracker that gives food truck owners the ability to connect their food truck to the app and be able to set their own location, opening times and pictures so that food enthusiasts can find them easier.
Owners can also send out the latest news and updates through a message system that can be seen on their individual page.

## Users
Food enthusiasts that want to easily find new food trucks will be met by a familiar interface based on the apple maps app. Here they can track their own current location in relation to the food trucks and can be redirected to apple maps if they want directions directly to a specific food truck. Users can easily keep themselves updated through the food truck messages at the bottom of the food truck page.
